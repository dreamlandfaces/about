**Karen Majewicz** is a composer and accordionist specializing in original scores for silent films. She first began accompanying films at the George Eastman Museum's Dryden Theater in Rochester, New York, and now presents new scores every year at local cinemas and festivals. She particularly enjoys scoring silent films created by women or featuring women-centered stories. Karen is also interested in broadening the space that the accordion occupies in many people's minds by performing new music, modern classical works, and art songs. Karen holds an ethnomusicology/music theory degree from the University of Washington and has studied music composition at the University of Minnesota.

**Andy McCormick** is a composer and multi-instrumentalist. He writes music for movies, theater, with lyricists, and for friends. Andy enjoys collaborating and is usually willing to experiment. He is a proud musical saw player, ardent supporter of new music, and willing to sing dissonant intervals.
