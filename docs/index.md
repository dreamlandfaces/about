**Karen Majewicz**  is a composer and accordionist specializing in original scores for silent films. She particularly enjoys scoring silent films created by women or featuring women-centered stories. Karen's academic background began with ethnomusicology, initially exploring accordion traditions, and evolved into graduate studies in music composition. Drawing inspiration from classical paintings, nautical imagery, and the elegance of trees, her compositions evoke wonder, introspection, and romance.

**Andy McCormick** is a composer and multi-instrumentalist. He writes music for movies, theater, with lyricists, and for friends. Andy enjoys collaborating and is usually willing to experiment. He is a proud musical saw player, ardent supporter of new music, and willing to sing dissonant intervals.
