After George Floyd was murdered by police, a bar next door was set on fire. Flames drifted over and the studio roof caught the flames, caving in completely. Firefighters put it out, but everything inside was destroyed. We lost our instruments, music books, recording equipment, albums, and projects. No one was hurt, but the only surviving objects were a French horn, a cornet, and a sign painted by our friend, Phil Vandervaart. We have many fond memories of the room -  making music, preparing for shows, movies, and recordings. </p>"},{"location":"ivy-building-fire/#before-the-fire","title":"Before the fire","text":""},{"location":"ivy-building-fire/#after-the-fire-1","title":"After the fire #1","text":""},{"location":"ivy-building-fire/#after-the-fire-2","title":"After the fire #2","text":""},{"location":"music/","title":"Music","text":"Icebreaker by Dreamland Faces Windy Sunday by Dreamland Faces \u00c9l\u00e9gie by Dreamland Faces"},{"location":"pastPerformances/","title":"Upcoming performances","text":""},{"location":"pastPerformances/#february-17-19-2023","title":"February 17-19, 2023","text":""},{"location":"pastPerformances/#moral-at-the-trylon-cinema","title":"MORAL at the Trylon Cinema","text":""},{"location":"pastPerformances/#april-4-2023","title":"April 4, 2023","text":""},{"location":"pastPerformances/#cinemas-first-nasty-women-silent-cinema-shorts-at-northrop","title":"Cinema's First Nasty Women: Silent Cinema Shorts at Northrop","text":"<p>Films TBD</p>"},{"location":"upcomingPerformances/","title":"Upcoming performances","text":""},{"location":"upcomingPerformances/#april-4-2023-730pm","title":"April 4, 2023, 7:30pm","text":""},{"location":"upcomingPerformances/#cinemas-first-nasty-women-contagious-revenge","title":"Cinema's First Nasty Women: Contagious Revenge","text":"<p>Silent Cinema Shorts at Northrop</p> <p></p> <p>CINEMA'S FIRST NASTY WOMEN: CONTAGIOUS REVENGE</p> <ol> <li> <p>The Dairymaid's Revenge (US, 1899, 2 min) </p> </li> <li> <p>La gr\u00e8ve des nourrices (France, 1907, 12 min) </p> </li> <li> <p>Victoire a ses nerfs (France, 1907, 3 min) </p> </li> <li> <p>Zo\u00e9 et la parapluie miraculeux (France, 1913, 4 min) </p> </li> <li> <p>Rembrandt de la rue Lepic (France, 1911, 6 min) </p> </li> <li> <p>La pile \u00e9lectrique de L\u00e9ontine (France, 1910, 6.5 min) </p> </li> <li> <p>Laughing Gas (US, 1907, 7.5 min)</p> </li> <li> <p>Daisy Doodad's Dial (U.K., 1914, 9 min)</p> </li> <li> <p>La peur des ombres (France, 1911, 4 min)</p> </li> <li> <p>The Night Rider (US, 1920, 25 min)</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"video/","title":"Video","text":""}]}
