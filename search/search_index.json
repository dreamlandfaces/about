After George Floyd was murdered by police, a bar next door was set on fire. Flames drifted over and the studio roof caught the flames, caving in completely. Firefighters put it out, but everything inside was destroyed. We lost our instruments, music books, recording equipment, albums, and projects. No one was hurt, but the only surviving objects were a French horn, a cornet, and a sign painted by our friend, Phil Vandervaart. We have many fond memories of the room -  making music, preparing for shows, movies, and recordings. </p>"},{"location":"ivy-building-fire/#before-the-fire","title":"Before the fire","text":""},{"location":"ivy-building-fire/#after-the-fire-1","title":"After the fire #1","text":""},{"location":"ivy-building-fire/#after-the-fire-2","title":"After the fire #2","text":""},{"location":"music/","title":"Music","text":"Icebreaker by Dreamland Faces Windy Sunday by Dreamland Faces \u00c9l\u00e9gie by Dreamland Faces"},{"location":"pastPerformances/","title":"Past performances","text":""},{"location":"pastPerformances/#april-4-2023-730pm","title":"April 4, 2023, 7:30pm","text":""},{"location":"pastPerformances/#cinemas-first-nasty-women-contagious-revenge","title":"Cinema's First Nasty Women: Contagious Revenge","text":"<p>Silent Cinema Shorts at Northrop</p> <p></p> <p>CINEMA'S FIRST NASTY WOMEN: CONTAGIOUS REVENGE</p> <ol> <li> <p>The Dairymaid's Revenge (US, 1899, 2 min) </p> </li> <li> <p>La gr\u00e8ve des nourrices (France, 1907, 12 min) </p> </li> <li> <p>Victoire a ses nerfs (France, 1907, 3 min) </p> </li> <li> <p>Zo\u00e9 et la parapluie miraculeux (France, 1913, 4 min) </p> </li> <li> <p>Rembrandt de la rue Lepic (France, 1911, 6 min) </p> </li> <li> <p>La pile \u00e9lectrique de L\u00e9ontine (France, 1910, 6.5 min) </p> </li> <li> <p>Laughing Gas (US, 1907, 7.5 min)</p> </li> <li> <p>Daisy Doodad's Dial (U.K., 1914, 9 min)</p> </li> <li> <p>La peur des ombres (France, 1911, 4 min)</p> </li> <li> <p>The Night Rider (US, 1920, 25 min)</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"pastPerformances/#february-17-19-2023","title":"February 17-19, 2023","text":""},{"location":"pastPerformances/#moral-at-the-trylon-cinema","title":"MORAL at the Trylon Cinema","text":""},{"location":"scoringSilents/","title":"Scoring Silents","text":"<p>FAQs on Composing Live Accompaniment for Silent Films</p>"},{"location":"scoringSilents/#when-were-silent-films-made","title":"When were silent films made?","text":"<ul> <li>Roughly: 1894-1929, with those from the 10s and 20s most commonly still available</li> <li>Early films were often experimental with interesting camera tricks. </li> <li>Films made through the 1910s may be challenging for modern audiences.

Silent films were shot at variable speeds (or \"frame rates\") anywhere from 12 fps to 26 fps. Film projectors used to have mechanisms to adjust the frame rate during playback. Most modern projectors do not have this functionality anymore - there are only a few theaters across the country that can do this. That is why you often see silent films that appear to be moving at breakneck speed. The \u201cscreener\u201d you use to score the film may not match the speed at which it gets projected.</li> <li>The films often feature offensive stereotypes and costuming. Are they still worth showing? There might be brief gags or background extras that you don\u2019t notice upon first viewing. You may need to do research about the filmmakers to understand the context. Depending upon your audience, acknowledging this can be helpful. </li> <li>Some viewers, especially silent film buffs, may prefer to hear authentic period music.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"scoringSilents/#why-would-a-modern-composer-score-an-old-silent-film","title":"Why would a modern composer score an old silent film?","text":"<ul> <li>A silent film score can facilitate creating a long form composition with built in thematic variations</li> <li>Visuals and action may inspire you to develop new themes or rhythms you haven't used before</li> <li>All films made in the US before 1923 are public domain.
