Karen holds an ethnomusicology/music theory degree from the University of Washington and has studied music composition at the University of Minnesota. Andy McCormick is a composer and multi-instrumentalist. He writes music for movies, theater, with lyricists, and for friends. Andy enjoys collaborating and is usually willing to experiment.

After George Floyd was murdered by police, a bar next door was set on fire. Flames drifted over and the studio roof caught the flames, caving in completely. Firefighters put it out, but everything inside was destroyed. We lost our instruments, music books, recording equipment, albums, and projects. No one was hurt, but the only surviving objects were a French horn, a cornet, and a sign painted by our friend, Phil Vandervaart. We have many fond memories of the room - making music, preparing for shows, movies, and recordings.
